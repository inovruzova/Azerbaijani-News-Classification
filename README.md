This project focuses on building a text classification model for Azerbaijani news articles. The task is to classify each article into one of six predefined categories using a dataset of 50,000 samples.

Key components:

- Preprocessing and feature extraction using Bag-of-Words and TF-IDF
- Training and evaluating multiple classifiers: Decision Tree, Na√Øve Bayes, and Support Vector Classifier
- Hyperparameter tuning and overfitting prevention
- Evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and confusion matrix
- Dimensionality reduction with visualization using 3 components for interpretability

The project emphasizes the end-to-end pipeline from raw text data to interpretable, high-performing classification results.
